OpenMP API has been employed to perform the parallelism to solve the problem. The OpenMP 
API is a portable, scalable model that gives shared-memory parallel programmers a simple and 
flexible interface for developing parallel applications on platforms ranging from embedded 
systems and accelerator devices to multicore systems and shared-memory systems.
